## Orchestrating Application

Now let's continue further to orchestrate [Application](https://github.com/sumanb007/crud-webapplication/blob/main/README.md) in Kubernetes.

As planned in project, let's first ensure:
1. NFS is setup in every cluster host. (like [here](https://github.com/sumanb007/Labs/blob/main/NFS%20setup.md))
2. Cluster is set up to Trust Private Registry with TLS. (like [here](https://github.com/sumanb007/kubernetes/blob/master/README.md#d-setting-up-cluster-to-trust-private-registry-with-tls))
